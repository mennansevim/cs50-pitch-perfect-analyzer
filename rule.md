Design an interactive music audition app inspired by Shazam, aimed at testing choir candidates’ vocal ranges. The storyboard should follow a minimal, modern UI and include the following steps:

Start Screen:

User selects gender (male/female) and microphone.
Minimalistic and modern layout.
Listening / Test Start:

Display a glowing, Shazam-style circular ring in the center (neon blue/purple light with a pulsing effect).
Automatically play a reference note (e.g., “C3”).
After a 1-second delay, the app listens through the microphone.
In the circle center, display text “C3 playing” followed by “Listening…”.
Correct / Incorrect Case:

If correct: The circle glows and the next note drops down to be tested.
If incorrect: Replay the same note, displaying a “Second Chance” message.
If failed again: Switch from descending notes to ascending notes starting from C3.
Progress List:

Show all successful notes in a vertical list below with a ✓ or ✗ icon (e.g., “C3 ✓, D3 ✓, E3 ✗”).
Final Result Screen:

Both downward notes from C3 and upward notes from C3 are tested.
Display a summary screen with large text indicating “Completed / Successful”.
Display the user’s vocal range (e.g., A2 – G4).
Show matching accuracy percentage (e.g., “99% Match” or “Failed”).
Decorate the background with a Shazam-style glowing ring and floating music notes.
Create visuals that clearly illustrate these steps, maintaining the Shazam-inspired neon aesthetic throughout.
